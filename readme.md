## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Focus Sessions
- Click **Start Focus Session** to begin.
- Set your desired focus duration (10‚Äì180 minutes).
- Mushrooms are collected passively based on focus time, and more mushrooms appear if you stay focused.
- You can stop early, but rewards scale with the time you remain focused.

### Mushroom Collection
- Mushrooms pop up on the background while you focus.
- Click on them to instantly collect, or let the session timer handle passive gathering.

### Scene and Time Dynamics
- The background image changes based on the time of day.
- Use the **Settings** panel to manually adjust the time and explore different scenes.
- A real-time clock overlay is available.

### End of Session
- After a session completes (or if you stop early), you'll see a **collection summary** listing how many mushrooms you gathered.
